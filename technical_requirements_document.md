# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
# Algorithmic Trading System with AI Integration

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical requirements for developing an algorithmic trading system that uses AI-based decision making (Claude Sonnet) to determine optimal trade execution strategies. The system will interface with the Alpaca API for market data and trade execution, and will include both frontend and backend components.  The frontend will be the primary point of interaction with the AI, using the Anthropic TypeScript SDK.

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture, with the frontend handling user interaction and AI integration, and the backend managing trade execution and market data:

1.  **Backend Server**: A Go-based server that:
    *   Interfaces with the Alpaca API
    *   Connects to Alpaca WebSocket streams
    *   Manages ticker symbols
    *   Implements trading algorithms
    *   Executes trades based on signals received from the frontend
    *   Tracks positions

2.  **Frontend**: A web-based UI that:
    *   Integrates with the Anthropic Claude SDK for AI interactions
    *   Displays real-time market data
    *   Shows account information and positions
    *   Provides interfaces for ticker selection, algorithm selection, and trading parameter configuration
    *   Visualizes trading signals and execution status
